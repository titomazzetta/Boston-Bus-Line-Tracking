<h1>Real Time Bus Tracking (Refactored)</h1>

<p>This repository contains the refactored code for a coding assignment that originally utilized the Google Maps API for map overlay functionality. The code has been modified to replace the Google Maps API with the Mapbox API. I then tweaked an refactored other parts of the code to have a more unique experience. 

<h2>Changes Made</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>API Replacement:</strong> The original Google Maps API has been replaced with the Mapbox API.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom Marker Icons:</strong> The standard marker icons have been replaced with custom icons sourced from "Font Awesome," a comprehensive library of scalable vector icons. These icons provide a more visually appealing and distinctive representation of map markers. </li>
  <li><strong>Directional Markers:</strong> The refactored code now includes different colors for markers based on their directions. This improvement enhances the visual clarity of the map and enables users to easily differentiate between various markers based on their intended direction. Additionally, the icons leave tracers of their previous locations, creating a visually dynamic experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features and Benefits</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mapbox API Integration:</strong> The utilization of the Mapbox API offers several advantages over the previous Google Maps API, including improved performance, enhanced customization options, and a wider range of map-related functionalities.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom Marker Icons:</strong> The use of custom icons sourced from "Font Awesome" adds a unique touch to the application, making it visually appealing and providing a more engaging user experience. "Font Awesome" offers an extensive collection of icons that can be easily integrated into the application.</li>
  <li><strong>Directional Markers:</strong> The implementation of different colors for markers based on their directions facilitates a clear and intuitive representation of map data, allowing users to quickly identify markers associated with specific directions. Moreover, the icons' tracers of previous locations add an interactive and dynamic element to the map visualization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
<p>To run this refactored code on your local machine, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download all three files (<code>index.html</code>, <code>mapanimation.js</code>, and <code>styles.css</code>) and place them in the same folder on your computer.</li>
    <li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in a web browser by dragging and dropping it into the browser window.</li>
    <li>Replace the existing API keys in the code with your own Mapbox API key. You can obtain an API key by signing up for an account on the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox website</a>.</li>
    <li>Run the application and verify that the map overlay, custom marker icons, directional markers, and icon tracers are functioning as intended.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Roadmap of Future Improvments</h2>
<p>Would love to figure how to create a tracing line that connects to the updated position of the markers</P

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to the original author of the coding assignment and the Mapbox team for providing an excellent mapping solution. Additionally, we sourced the updated custom marker icons from "Font Awesome," a comprehensive library of scalable vector icons that greatly enhanced the visual representation of our map markers. Their contributions have been instrumental in the development of this refactored codebase.</p>
